## 🚀 Mission

The [Audio/Visuals](https://www.notion.so/Audio-Visuals-f80bc9366ace4e29b2b11c17ab60cf99?pvs=21) team **provides good audio and good visuals** at Mosaik events such as church services and special events, helping to **open people's hearts to the Gospel**.

_Our purpose is based on this scripture:_

> “Ezra the scribe stood on a high wooden platform that had been made for the occasion. [...] Ezra stood on the platform in full view of all the people. When they saw him open the book, they all rose to their feet. Then Ezra praised the Lord , the great God, and all the people chanted, “Amen! Amen!” as they lifted their hands. Then they bowed down and worshiped the Lord with their faces to the ground.” (Nehemiah 8:4-6)

### Our Foundation as Mosaik Berlin

| **Gospel-centered** (Reformed) | The gospel of grace is the center piece of our Mosaik. It is not only the door to the Christian life, it is also the way of the Christian life for every one of us.     |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Spirit-led** (Charismatic)   | As a church we are curious and hungry to see the Holy Spirit move in and through us. Without him we are powerless, with him we are unstoppable and unpredictable.       |
| **Mission-minded** (Missional) | It is our dream to be a blessing for our city. We want to be outward focused in everything we do and share Jesus with everybody everywhere through our words & actions. |

### Our Goals as Mosaik Berlin

We want to be a church …

- … where people can get to know & love Jesus. (Worship)
- … where authentic relationships are cultivated. (Community)
- … where lives are being changed. (Discipleship)
- … that cares for the hurts & needs of others. (Ministry)
- … which is a part of God's work in this world. (Mission)

### Goals for the Audio/Visuals team

From those we can derive the following goals for the team:

💡 **The Audio/Visuals team provides great audio and visuals to help people to …**

- … get to know & love Jesus (Worship),
- … cultivate authentic relationships (Community),
- … change their lives (Discipleship),
- … care for the hurts & needs of others (Ministry), and
- … further God‘s work in the world (Mission).

Although we will always have a focus on the goal of worship, we can contribute to all 5 goals.

## 🎛️ Scope for this GitHub organization

We treat **production** as everything that happens between the presenter clicking the remote and the audience leaving the venue:

- **Sound systems** — PA design, speaker placement, cabling standards
- **Live sound mixing** — consoles, stageboxes, Dante networks, show files
- **Presentation control** — slide computers, switchers, redundant playback
- **Slide preparation** — templates, guidelines, asset pipelines
- **Show calling & cues** — run‑of‑show docs, timecode, comms setup

If it lives in a rack or on a timeline, it probably belongs here.
